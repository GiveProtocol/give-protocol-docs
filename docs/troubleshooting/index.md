### Clear Browser Cache
Many issues can be resolved by clearing your browser's cache and cookies:

2. Find "Privacy" or "History" section
3. Clear cached images and files
4. Clear cookies for giveprotocol.io
5. Refresh the page

### Check Wallet Connection
If transactions aren't working:
1. Ensure your wallet extension is unlocked
2. Verify you're on the Moonbeam network
3. Check you have enough GLMR for gas fees
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet

### Disable Browser Extensions
Some browser extensions (especially ad blockers) can interfere with the platform:
1. Try disabling extensions temporarily
2. Use an incognito/private window
3. Try a different browser

### Check Network Status
Occasionally, the Moonbeam network may experience congestion:
1. Check [Moonbeam network status](https://moonscan.io)
2. Wait a few minutes and try again
3. Transactions may take longer during high network activity

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why did my donation fail?

Common reasons for failed donations:
- **Insufficient balance** - Check you have enough tokens plus gas fees
- **Wrong network** - Ensure your wallet is connected to Moonbeam
- **Approval needed** - Some tokens require a separate approval transaction
- **Slippage** - Try increasing slippage tolerance for volatile tokens

### Why can't I connect my wallet?

Wallet connection issues are usually caused by:
- **Outdated wallet extension** - Update to the latest version
- **Popup blockers** - Allow popups for giveprotocol.io
- **Multiple wallets** - Disable other wallet extensions temporarily
- **Wrong browser** - Try Chrome or Firefox

### Where is my tax receipt?

Tax receipts are sent automatically to your registered email. Check:
- Your spam/junk folder
- That your email address is correct in your profile
- The dashboard for downloadable receipts
- That the donation was to an eligible organization

### Why isn't my donation showing?

Donations may not appear immediately due to:
- **Blockchain confirmation** - Wait for transaction to be confirmed
- **Page caching** - Refresh the page or clear cache
- **Dashboard sync** - Allow a few minutes for dashboard to update
