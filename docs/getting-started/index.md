## What is Give Protocol?

Give Protocol is a blockchain-based charitable giving platform that connects donors with verified nonprofit organizations and volunteers. We use cryptocurrency technology to ensure:

- **Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain
- **Security**: Smart contracts protect both donors and organizations
- **Efficiency**: Lower fees mean more of your donation reaches those in need
- **Impact Tracking**: See exactly how your contributions make a difference
