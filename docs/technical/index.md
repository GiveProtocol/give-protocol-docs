## Platform Architecture

Give Protocol is built on the Moonbeam network, an Ethereum-compatible parachain on Polkadot. This provides:

- **EVM Compatibility** - Use standard Ethereum tooling and wallets
- **Cross-Chain Potential** - Future support for cross-chain donations
- **Low Fees** - Significantly lower transaction costs than Ethereum mainnet
- **Fast Finality** - Quick transaction confirmation times

## Smart Contract Overview

Our platform uses several key smart contracts:

1. **Donation Contract** - Handles donation transactions and fee distribution
2. **Organization Registry** - Stores verified organization information on-chain
3. **Volunteer Contract** - Records volunteer hours and credentials
4. **CEF Contract** - Manages Charitable Endowment Fund operations

All contracts are audited by leading security firms and are open source.

## API Access

Give Protocol provides a REST API for:

- Querying organization information
- Retrieving donation history
- Accessing impact metrics
- Integrating with external applications

## Security Practices

- **Smart Contract Audits** - Regular third-party security audits
- **Bug Bounty Program** - Rewards for responsible vulnerability disclosure
- **No Private Key Storage** - We never have access to user funds
- **Encryption** - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
